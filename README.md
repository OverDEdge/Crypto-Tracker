# Crypto Tracker

## Description
A Crypto Tracker app that can retrieve the current prices of a number of crypto coins in a FIAT of a users choosing.
The tracker uses the free API provided by "https://nomics.com".

## Additions
It is very simple to add more currencies to the UI, just by adding items to the cryptoList the coins will be added to the ListView.

## Future Ideas
A future idea might be to give the user possibility to directly manipulate the coin list in the app.
Another future improvement might be to automatically scale the content in the crypto cards. Meaning to display the prices in a cleaner way with a preset precision and more styling.
